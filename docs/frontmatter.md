Every file within a Yarn site is able to add optional additional metadata to itself in the form of frontmatter. Frontmatter is a block of YAML data this found at the front of a source file, allowing you to add additional data about the file.

For example if you had a file named `about.md` it might have as its content:

```markdown
---
title: About
layout: page
```
```
