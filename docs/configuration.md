title: Configuration

Most of Yarn's flexibility comes from its ability to be configured and changed to meet your needs.

All of the configuration for your Yarn site resides in your `_config.yml` file. This file is what Yarn uses to decide how to build your site.

Understanding the `_config.yml` file, and how to update it, is how you will make Yarn work best for you.
